                       Hello! I'm Eddy, a high schooler from Massachusetts and the developer of everything within this website! I'm particularly interested in the fields of astronomy and astrophysics, as well as robotics. My hobbies include writing, editing YouTube videos, and Science Olympiad. I am also an avid Dunkin' enjoyer.
                    </p>

                

                    <p class="note">As a developer I am still learning. However, I hope the projects I make will get way better over time. You can try some of them out by clicking the Projects tab above!</p>

                            This project uses your location or IP to determine your closest MBTA Commuter Rail station, then uses the MBTA V3 API to pull train data (location, speed, distance) and shows you which trains are coming your way. It also predicts when your train will arrive, and soon hopefully will be reporting delays as well!

                        Another great quiz game I created! All controls are keyboard only so that the game can be casted with a projector in front of a real audience and controlled by an operator from the side.
                    </p>
                    <p class="note">Controls: Space to start a new game. Press Z twice to open a question and reveal answer choices. Press A/B/C/D to answer. Press X to reveal the correct answer, and Z twice to advance to the next question. Q/W/E for lifelines (W twice for Ask The Audience), R twice and then L to walk away. Yes, they're complicated.</p>
