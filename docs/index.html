                        It's been a while since I posted here! I'm just announcing that there will be new projects added to the site starting very soon! During the summer, I will be working on a new major project (spoiler: online game) as well as a few smaller ones.
                    </p>
                    <p class="note">I actually hope to make at least two online games. For now, once school ends this year, development will be at full speed!</p>

                    </p>
                    <p class="note">I'm happy to announce that servers are finally up again! I'm using Render, a service that is similar to Heroku, but easier and best of all, free!</p>
                    <p class="note">
                        Everything is back to normal. However, while the Firebase site is static, Render servers operate only for 750 hours each month and shut down after 15 minutes, just like Heroku. If you visit the site and servers are down, wait about 30 seconds and then they should have booted up.

                        I'm coming to a decision on what to do with the online services on this website.

                    <p class="note">Either I will go back to Heroku and give them money to run the site, or I will go learn how to operate an AWS project.</p>
                    <p class="note">
                        I've had many ideas of online projects that I want to get set up, but without a server that won't be able to happen. Gladly, I hope we will have some new servers up soon!

                        Online servers will be down indefinitely while I work out problems with the system.
                    </p>
                    <p class="note">While I am sure that Firebase can take on real-time communication between client and server, it would involve setting up an entirely new database as well as updating the existing 17,000 lines of server code running this site.</p>
                    <p class="note">
                        Learning how to do this feels wasteful especially because I want to set up a MySQL database for this site, and Firebase is intended to serve as a backup while I try to find a solution and bring back the online games.
                    </p>
                    <p class="note">
                        At some point, I will have to rebuild the entire backend, which will probably happen over this summer. For now, enjoy the offline games (there are a good amount of them!) I'll get live services up as soon as I can.

                </p>
                <p class="note">My previous host reached out to me regarding an issue with bandwidth use. They gave me 24 hours to fix the issue, which I attempted to do, but suspended my hosting after only 14. I successfully charged them back for the money!</p>
                <p class="note">
                    I am now using Google Firebase. It took 10 minutes to setup and so far, has been amazing! I also moved my domain off the previous host (same company) - since Firebase is free, I can guarantee eddyzow.net will be up for the next 3 years!

                        As the database has moved from Virginia to Arizona, I am experiencing some severe slowness with the database (~20 ms ping -> ~400 ms ping) so I will be migrating servers to a MySQL database to speed up the live games. More will be coming soon! Stay tuned!
