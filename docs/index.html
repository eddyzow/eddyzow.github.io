                            This is my major project for the year, and it's an interactive starmap of the night sky. For now, it is under construction, but when complete, you will be able to get data on hundreds of thousands of stars, see real-time data on planets and systems, and see what the night sky will look like for you based on your location. This project was created with Three.js, and is an introduction for me to the world of 3D JavaScript and rendering.
