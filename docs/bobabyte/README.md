# BobaByte

Welcome to the source code for [BobaByte](https://eddyzow.github.io/bobabyte), a social coding event being held in late October 2024. This is the code making up our website! Our hackathon will be for middle and high schoolers, and there will be free food, merch, and boba served! We are fiscally supported by Hack Club, an organization I really respect. If you're in the Greater Boston area, you should pull up to BobaByte. See you there!
