        <h1>Is BobaByte a hackathon?</h1>
        <p>
          Both yes and no! A traditional hackathon is often targeted towards
          experienced coding teams and might last up to a few days long. We
          built BobaByte as a way to let new coders express their creativity -
          and win prizes along the way!
