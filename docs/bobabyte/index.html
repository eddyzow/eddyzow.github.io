        <h2>About the Team Behind BobaByte
        </h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          We're Aprameya, Eddy, Rick, and Tanish, four seniors at Acton-Boxborough Regional High School (Acton, MA) with a mission to bring a high-quality coding event to the Greater Boston area. We believe that with today's world becoming increasingly digital, it is crucial for youth to become well-versed in programming for success in the modern workforce. We wanted to set up an event that would give middle and high schoolers the opportunity to learn and win prizes, plus enjoy the best drink ever - bubble tea!

            <div class="bold">What's a hackathon? Is BobaByte a hackathon?</div>
            <p>A traditional hackathon is an event where teams "hack" (code projects) for a period of time, often 24 hours. These projects are then judged, and the winners receive prizes. BobaByte is like a hackathon, but the projects are smaller (8 hours) and we will be hosting workshops throughout the day to help young people of all skill levels.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq">
            <div class="bold">What if I don't have any coding experience?</div>
            <p>That's totally fine! This social coding event is about teaching people how awesome coding is. Our Programming Leads, experienced in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, C++, Java, Python, and Scratch, can help guide you in the right direction! If your project strikes a chord in the judges' hearts, you might even win Best Beginner!</p>
