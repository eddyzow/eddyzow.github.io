    <p>Where Is My Commuter Rail Train?</p>
    <p>This tool serves to locate the next MBTA Commuter Rail trains to the station closest to your location and estimates the distance and time of such trains. </p>

    <p id="station-estimate">Trying to locate your nearest MBTA Station...</p>

    <p id="data-output"></p>
    <p>Please note that this webapp collects IP geolocation data as well as user-consented geolocation data to determine the nearest MBTA station to you. If you do not consent to the use of such data, do not use this app.</p>

    <div id="train-carrier"></div>

    <p>May be misleading because time to arrival will be increasing for trains traveling away from you.</p>

    <p>Currently does not support stations that serve more than one line of the Commuter Rail (including North and South Stations). I will be working on this.</p>
