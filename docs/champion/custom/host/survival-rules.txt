Blitz Gamemode: Survival Rules

A new gamemode on Blitz where the goal is to survive as long as you can as a combined team of players!

Your team starts with a total of 1,000,000 health (HP) (this amount also can be custom set by the host) and the HP drains more and more as the game progresses. The game ends
when your team reaches 0 HP.

Answer questions to earn power, and buy upgrades to increase the amount of power you earn per question! When you answer questions, you generate health for
the team that scales based on the amount of power you are earning.

With power, you can also purchase health boost upgrades that further increase the health you are generating for your team.

Survive as long as you can, good luck!
